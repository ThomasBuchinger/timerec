	If no task with this name exists, a basic task-object will be created.
Use '--start' and '--est' to record the begin and estimated finish , relative to right now.
'--est' has no effect, except reminding you to finish the task or update your estimate

    # Started to work on TICKET-13 15 minutes ago, and be reminded in 1h
    timerec start TICKET-13 --start -15m --est 1h
